Abstract

   This document proposes a method of extending unicast DNS to support
   long-lived queries, thus allowing clients to learn about changes to
   DNS data without polling the server.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>

   In dynamic environments, DNS Service Discovery [<a href="#ref-DNS-SD" title="&quot;DNS-Based Service Discovery&quot;">DNS-SD</a>] benefits
   significantly from clients being able to learn about changes to
   DNS information via a mechanism that is both more timely and more
   efficient than simple polling. Such a mechanism enables "live
   browses" that learn when a new instance of a service appears, or when
   an existing service disappears from the network, and allows clients
   to monitor changes to a service. Multicast DNS [<a href="#ref-mDNS" title="&quot;Multicast DNS&quot;">mDNS</a>] supports this
   natively. When a host on the network publishes or deletes DNS
   records, these records are multicast to other hosts on the network.
   These hosts deliver the records to interested clients (applications
   running on the host). Hosts also send occasional queries to the
   network in case gratuitous announcements are not received due to
   packet loss, and to detect records lost due to their publishers
   crashing or having become disconnected from the network.

   There is currently no equivalent in traditional unicast DNS. Queries
   are "one-shot" -- a name server will answer a query once, returning
   the results available at that instant in time. Changes could be
   inferred via polling of the name server. This solution is not
   scalable, however, as a low polling rate could leave the client with
   stale information, and a high polling rate would have an adverse
   impact on the network and server.

   Therefore, an extension to DNS is required that enables a client to
   issue long-lived queries. This extension would allow a DNS server to
   notify clients about changes to DNS data.


<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>. Conventions and Terminology Used in this Document</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in "Key words for use in
   RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [<a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>].


<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>. Mechanisms</span>

   DNS Long-Lived Queries (DNS-LLQ) is implemented using the standard
   DNS message format [<a href="./rfc1035">RFC 1035</a>] in conjunction with an ENDS0 OPT
   pseudo-RR [<a href="./rfc2671">RFC 2671</a>] with a new OPT and RDATA format proposed here.
   Encoding the LLQ request in an OPT RR allows for implementation of
   LLQ with minimal modification to a name server's front-end, and will
   cause servers that do not implement LLQ to automatically return an
   appropriate error (NOTIMPL).

   Note that this protocol is designed for moderate data set sizes, and
   moderate change rates. Data sets in response to queries that
   frequently exceed a single packet, or that experience a rapid change
   rate, may have undesirable performance implications.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-3.2" href="#section-3.2">3.2</a> Opt-RR Format</span>

   All OPT-RRs used in LLQs are formatted as follows:

   Field Name        Field Type     Description
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   NAME              domain name    empty (root domain)
   TYPE              u_int16_t      OPT
   CLASS             u_int16_t      0*
   TTL               u_int32_t      0
   RDLEN             u_int16_t      describes RDATA
   RDATA             octet stream   (see below)

   * The CLASS field indicates, as per [<a href="./rfc2671">RFC 2671</a>], the sender's UDP
   payload size. However, clients and servers need not be required to
   determine their reassembly buffer size, path MTU, etc. to support
   LLQ. Thus, the sender of an LLQ Request or Response MAY set the CLASS
   field to 0.  The recipient MUST ignore the class field if it is set
   to 0.

   This data format, consisting of (OPTION-CODE, OPTION-LEN,
   LLQ-Metadata) tuples, may be repeated an arbitrary number of times in
   the RDATA section, with the RDLEN field set accordingly.


<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>. LLQ Address and Port Identification</span>

   A client MAY send LLQ setup and control messages to an intermediate
   DNS cache. If the cache serves as an intermediate LLQ proxy, it will
   communicate directly with the client, and with the server on behalf
   of one or more clients.

   LLQ requests sent to a DNS Cache MUST be sent to port 53.

   DNS caches not implementing LLQ proxying will return a NOTIMPL or
   FORMERR error to the client in the DNS message header -- the
   intermediate cache will not forward the request, as [<a href="./rfc2671">RFC 2671</a>]
   specifies that OPT-RRs are not to be forwarded. If the client
   receives a NOTIMPL error from a DNS cache, the client SHOULD contact
   the server directly.


<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.1" href="#section-4.1">4.1</a> Server Address and Port Identification</span>

   If a client's DNS cache does not implement LLQ proxying, the client
   requires a mechanism to determine which server to send LLQ operations
   to. Additionally, some firewalls block communication directly with a
   name server on port 53 to avoid spoof responses. However, this
   direct communication is necessary for LLQs. Thus, servers MAY listen
   for LLQs on a different port (5352). Clients also therefore need a
   mechanism to determine which port to send LLQ operations to.

<span class="grey">Internet Draft            DNS Long-Lived Queries        10th August 2006</span>


   The client determines the server responsible for a given LLQ much as
   a client determines which server to send a dynamic update to. The
   client begins by sending a standard DNS query for the name of the
   LLQ, with type SOA. The server MUST answer with that SOA record in
   the Answer section, if the record exists. The server SHOULD include
   an SOA record for that name's zone in the Authority section, if the
   LLQ name (type SOA) does not exist. For example, a query for
   _ftp._tcp.apple.com. may return an SOA record named apple.com. in the
   Authority section if there is no SOA record named
   _ftp._tcp.apple.com. If, in this case, the server does not include
   the SOA record in the Authority section, the client strips the
   leading label from the name and tries again, repeating until an
   answer is received.

   Upon learning the zone (SOA), the client then constructs and sends an
   SRV query for the name _dns-llq._udp.&lt;zone&gt;,e.g.
   _dns-llq._udp.apple.com.

   A server implementing LLQ MUST answer with an SRV record [<a href="./rfc2782">RFC 2782</a>]
   for this name. The SRV RDATA is as follows:

   PRIORITY   0 (unused)
   WEIGHT     0 (unused)
   PORT       53 or 5352
   TARGET     name of server providing LLQs for the requested zone

   The SRV target and the SOA mname SHOULD be identical. In addition,
   the server SHOULD include its address record(s) in the Additionals
   section of the response.

   If the server does not include its address record in the Additionals
   section, the client SHOULD query explicitly for the address record
   with the name of the SRV target.

   The client MUST send all LLQ requests, refreshes, and acknowledgments
   to the name server specified in the SRV target, at the address
   contained in the address record for that target. Note that the
   queries described in this section (including those for SOA and SRV
   records) MAY be sent to an intermediate DNS cache -- they need not be
   sent directly to the name server.

   If, on issuing the SRV query, the client receives an NXDOMAIN
   response indicating that the SRV record does not exist, the client
   SHOULD conclude that the server does not support an LLQ in the
   requested zone. The client then SHOULD NOT send an LLQ request for
   the desired name, instead utilizing the behavior for LLQ-unaware
   servers described in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> "LLQ Setup".

   Servers should send all messages to the source address and port of
   the LLQ setup message received from the client.


<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>. LLQ Setup</span>

   An LLQ is initiated by a client, and is completed via a four-way
   handshake. This handshake provides resilience to packet loss,
   demonstrates client reachability, and reduces denial of service
   attack opportunities (see <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a> "Security Considerations").


<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1" href="#section-5.1">5.1</a> Setup Message Retransmission</span>

   LLQ Setup Requests and Responses sent by the client SHOULD be
   retransmitted if no acknowledgments are received. The client SHOULD
   re-try up to two more times (for a total of 3 attempts) before
   considering the server down or unreachable. The client MUST wait at
   least 2 seconds before the first retransmission and 4 seconds between
   the first and second retransmissions. The client SHOULD listen for a
   response for at least 8 seconds after the 3rd attempt before
   considering the server down or unreachable. Upon determining a
   server to be down, a client MAY periodically attempt to re-initiate
   an LLQ setup, at a rate of not more than once per hour.

   Servers MUST NOT re-transmit acknowledgments that do not generate
   responses from the client. Retransmission in setup is client-driven,
   freeing servers from maintaining timers for incomplete LLQ setups. If
   servers receive duplicate messages from clients (perhaps due to the
   loss of the server's responses mid-flight), the server MUST re-send
   its reply (possibly modifying the LEASE-LIFE as described in <a href="#section-5.2.4">Section</a>
   <a href="#section-5.2.4">5.2.4</a> "ACK + Answers").

   Servers MUST NOT garbage collect LLQs that fail to complete the four-
   way handshake until the initially granted LEASE-LIFE has elapsed.

   The four phases of the handshake include:

   4) ACK + Answers        server to client, confirms setup and

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.2.1" href="#section-5.2.1">5.2.1</a> Setup Request</span>

   A request for an LLQ is formatted like a standard DNS query, but with
   an OPT RR containing LLQ metadata in its Additional section. LLQ
   setup requests are identified by the LLQ-SETUP opcode and a
   zero-valued LLQ-ID.

   The request MAY contain multiple questions to set up multiple LLQs.
   A request consisting of multiple questions MUST contain multiple LLQ
   metadata sections, one per question, with metadata sections in the
   same order as the questions they correspond to (i.e. the first
   metadata section corresponds to the first question, the second
   metadata section corresponds to the second question, etc.)  If
   requesting multiple LLQs, clients SHOULD request the same LEASE-LIFE
   for each LLQ. Requests over UDP MUST NOT contain multiple questions
   if doing so would cause the message to not fit in a single packet.

   A client MUST NOT request multiple identical LLQs (i.e. containing
   the same qname/type/class) from a single source IP address and port.

   The query MUST NOT be for record type ANY (255), class ANY (255), or
   class NONE (0).

   Upon receiving an LLQ Setup Request, a server implementing LLQs will
   send a Setup Challenge to the requester (client). An LLQ Setup
   Challenge is a DNS Response, with the DNS message ID matching that of
   the request, and with all questions contained in the request present
   in the Question section of the response. Additionally, the
   challenge contains a single OPT-RR with an LLQ metadata section for
   each LLQ request, indicating the success or failure of each request.
   Metadata sections MUST be in the same order as the questions they
   correspond to. Note that some LLQs in a request containing multiple

   LLQ Metadata field descriptions:

   ERROR-CODE:     Possible values include:

      NO-ERROR:    The LLQ Setup Request was successful.

      FORMAT-ERR:  The LLQ was improperly formatted. Note that if the
                   rest of the DNS message is properly formatted, the
                   DNS header error code MUST NOT include a format error
                   code, as this would cause confusion between a server
                   that does not understand the LLQ format, and a client
                   that sends malformed LLQs.

      SERV-FULL:   The server cannot grant the LLQ request because it is
                   overloaded, or the request exceeds the server's rate
                   limit (see <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a> "Security Considerations").
                   Upon returning this error, the server MUST include
                   in the LEASE-LIFE field a time interval, in seconds,
                   after which the client may re-try the LLQ Setup.

      STATIC:      The data for this name and type is not expected to
                   change frequently, and the server therefore does not
                   support the requested LLQ. The client MUST NOT poll
                   for this name and type, nor should it re-try the LLQ
                   Setup, and should instead honor the normal resource
                   record TTLs returned. To reduce server load, an
                   administrator MAY return this error for all records
                   with types other than PTR and TXT as a matter of
                   course.

      BAD-VERS:    The protocol version specified in the client's
                   request is not supported by the server.

      UNKNOWN-ERR: The LLQ was not granted for an unknown reason


   LLQ-ID: On success, a random number generated by the server that is
   unique for the requested name/type/class. The LLQ-ID SHOULD be an
   unguessable random number. A possible method of allocating LLQ-IDs
   with minimal bookkeeping would be to store the time, in seconds since
   the Epoch, in the high 32 bits of the field, and a cryptographically
   generated 32-bit random integer in the low 32 bits.

   On error, the LLQ-ID is set to 0.

   LEASE-LIFE: On success, the actual life of the LLQ, in seconds.
   Value may be greater than, less than, or equal to the value requested
   by the client, as per the server administrator's policy. The server
   MAY discard the LLQ after this LEASE-LIFE expires unless the LLQ has
   been renewed by the client (see <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a> "Security Considerations").
   The server MUST NOT generate events (see <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> "Event Responses")
   for expired LLQs.

   On SERV-FULL error, LEASE-LIFE MUST be set to a time interval, in
   seconds, after which the client may re-try the LLQ Setup.

   On other errors, the LEASE-LIFE MUST be set to 0.


<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.2.3" href="#section-5.2.3">5.2.3</a> Challenge Response</span>

   Upon issuing a Setup Request, a client listens for a Setup Challenge
   (5.2.2), re-transmitting the request as necessary (5.1). After
   receiving a successful Challenge, the client SHOULD send a Challenge
   Response to the server. This Challenge Response is a DNS request
   with questions from the request and challenge, and a single OPT-RR in
   the Additional section, with the OPT-RR RDATA identical to the
   OPT-RR RDATA contained in the Setup Request ACK (i.e. echoing, for
   each set of fields, the random LLQ-ID and the granted lease life). If
   the challenge response contains multiple questions, the first
   question MUST correspond to the first OPT-RR RDATA tuple, etc.

   If the Setup Request fails with a STATIC error, the client MUST NOT
   poll the server. The client SHOULD honor the resource record TTLs
   contained in the response.

   If the Setup Request fails with a SERV-FULL error, the client MAY
   re-try the LLQ Setup Request (5.2.1) after the time indicated in the
   LEASE-LIFE field.

   If the Setup Request fails with an error other than STATIC or
   SERV-FULL, or the server is determined not to support LLQ (i.e. the
   client receives FORMERROR or NOTIMPL in the DNS message header), the
   client MAY poll the server periodically with standard DNS queries,
   inferring Add and Remove events (see <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a> "Security
   Considerations") by comparing answers to these queries. The client
   SHOULD NOT poll more than once every 30 minutes for a given query.
   The client MUST NOT poll if it receives a STATIC error code in the
   acknowledgment.


<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.2.4" href="#section-5.2.4">5.2.4</a> ACK + Answers</span>

   Upon receiving a Challenge Response, a server MUST return an
   acknowledgment, completing the LLQ setup, and provide all current
   answers to the question(s).

   To acknowledge a successful Challenge Response, i.e. a Challenge
   Response in which the LLQ-ID and LEASE-LIFE echoed by the client
   match the values issued by the server, the server MUST send a DNS
   response containing all available answers to the question(s)
   contained in the original Setup Request, along with all additional
   resource records appropriate for those answers in the Additionals
   section, followed lastly by an OPT-RR formatted as follows:

   LEASE-LIFE        u_int32_t      Remaining life of LLQ, in seconds


   If there is a significant delay in receiving a Setup Response, or
   multiple Setup Responses are issued (possibly because they were lost
   en route to the client, causing the client to re-send the Setup
   Response), the server MAY decrement the LEASE-LIFE by the time
   elapsed since the Setup Request ACK was initially issued.

   If the setup is completed over UDP and all initially available
   answers to the question(s), additional records, and the OPT-RR do not
   fit in a single packet, some or all additional records (excluding the
   OPT-RR) MUST be omitted. If, after omission of all additional
   records, the answers still do not fit in a single message, answers
   MUST be removed until the message fits in a single packet. These
   answers not delivered in the Setup Response ACK MUST be delivered
   without undue delay to the client via Add Events (<a href="#section-7">Section 7</a> "LLQ
   Lease-Life Expiration").


<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.3" href="#section-5.3">5.3</a> Resource Record TTLs</span>

   The TTLs of resource records contained in answers to successful LLQs
   SHOULD be ignored by the client. The client MAY cache LLQ answers
   until the client receives a gratuitous announcement (see <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>
   "Event Responses") indicating that the answer to the LLQ has changed.
   The client MUST NOT cache answers after the LLQs LEASE-LIFE expires
   without being refreshed (see <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a> "Security Considerations").
   If an LLQ request fails, the client SHOULD NOT cache answers for a
   period longer than the client's polling interval.

   Note that resource records intended specifically to be transmitted
   via LLQs (e.g. DNS Service Discovery resource records) may have
   unusually short TTLs. This is because it is assumed that the records
   may change frequently, and that a client's cache coherence will be
   maintained via the LLQ and gratuitous responses. Short TTLs prevent
   stale information from residing in intermediate DNS caches that are
   not LLQ-aware.

   TTLs of resource records included in the Additional section of an

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>. Event Responses</span>

   When a change ("event") occurs to a name server's zone, the server
   MUST check if the new or deleted resource records answer any LLQs.
   If so, the resource records MUST be sent to the LLQ requesters in the
   form of a gratuitous DNS response sent to the client, with the
   question(s) being answered in the Question section, and answers to
   these questions in the Answer section. The response also includes
   an OPT RR as the last record in the Additional section. This OPT RR
   contains, in its RDATA, an entry for each LLQ being answered in the
   message. Entries must include the LLQ-ID. This reduces the
   potential for spoof events being sent to a client.

   Gratuitous responses for a single LLQ MAY be batched, such that
   multiple resource records are contained in a single message.
   Responses MUST NOT be batched if this would cause a message that
   would otherwise fit in a single packet to be truncated. While
   responses MAY be deferred to provide opportunities for batching,
   responses SHOULD NOT be delayed, for purposes of batching, for more
   than 30 seconds, as this would cause an unacceptable latency for the
   client.

   After sending a gratuitous response, the server MUST listen for an
   acknowledgment from the client. If the client does not respond, the
   server MUST re-send the response. The server MUST re-send 2 times
   (for a total of 3 transmissions), after which the server MUST
   consider the client to be unreachable and delete its LLQ. The server
   MUST listen for 2 seconds before re-sending the response, 4 more
   seconds before re-sending again, and must wait an additional 8
   seconds after the 3rd transmission before terminating the LLQ.

   record must be sent in the Answer section of the event to the client.
   Records that normally accompany this record in responses MAY be
   included in the Additional section, as per truncation restrictions
   described above.


<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-6.2" href="#section-6.2">6.2</a> Remove Events</span>

   Remove events occur when a resource record previously sent to a
   client, either in an initial response, or in an Add Event, becomes
   invalid (normally as a result of being removed via a dynamic update).
   The deleted resource record is sent in the Answer section of the
   event to the client. The resource record TTL is set to -1,
   indicating that the record has been removed.


<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-6.3" href="#section-6.3">6.3</a> Gratuitous Response Acknowledgments</span>

   Upon receiving a gratuitous response ("event"), the client MUST send
   an acknowledgment to the server. This acknowledgment is a DNS
   response echoing the OPT-RR contained in the event, with the message
   ID of the gratuitous response echoed in the message header. The
   acknowledgment MUST be sent to the source IP address and port from
   which the event originated.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-7.1" href="#section-7.1">7.1</a> Refresh Request</span>

   If the client desires to maintain the LLQ beyond the duration
   specified in the LEASE-LIFE field of the Request Acknowledgment
   (5.2), the client MUST send a Refresh Request. A Refresh Request is
   identical to an LLQ Challenge Response (5.3), but with the LLQ-OPCODE
   set to LLQ-REFRESH. Unlike a Challenge Response, a Refresh Request
   returns no answers.

   The client SHOULD refresh an LLQ when 80% of its lease life has
   elapsed.

<span class="grey">Internet Draft            DNS Long-Lived Queries        10th August 2006</span>


   As a means of reducing network traffic, when constructing refresh
   messages the client SHOULD include all LLQs established with a given
   server, even those not yet close to expiration. However, at least
   one LLQ MUST have elapsed at least 80% of its original LEASE-LIFE.
   The client MUST NOT include additional LLQs if doing so would cause
   the message to no longer fit in a single packet. In this case, the
   LLQs furthest from expiration should be omitted such that the message
   fits in a single packet.  (These LLQs SHOULD be refreshed in a
   separate message when 80% of one or more of their lease lives have
   elapsed.)  When refreshing multiple LLQs simultaneously, the message
   contains multiple questions, and a single OPT-RR with multiple LLQ
   metadata sections, one per question, with the metadata sections in
   the same order as the questions they correspond to.

   The client SHOULD specify the original lease life granted in the LLQ
   response as the desired LEASE-LIFE in the refresh request. If
   refreshing multiple LLQs simultaneously, the client SHOULD request
   the same lease life for all LLQs being refreshed (with the exception
   of termination requests, see below).

   The client SHOULD specify a lease life of 0 to terminate an LLQ prior
   to its scheduled expiration (for instance, when the client terminates
   a DNS Service Discovery browse operation, or a client is about to go
   to sleep or shut down.)

   The client SHOULD listen for an acknowledgment from the server. The
   client MAY re-try up to two more times (for a total of 3 attempts)
   before considering the server down or unreachable. The client MUST
   NOT re-try a first time before 90% of the lease life has expired, and
   MUST NOT re-try again before 95% of the lease life has expired. If
   the server is determined to be down, the client MAY periodically
   attempt to re-establish the LLQ via an LLQ Setup Request message.
   The client MUST NOT attempt the LLQ Setup Request more than once per
   hour.


<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-7.2" href="#section-7.2">7.2</a> LLQ Refresh Acknowledgment</span>

   Upon receiving an LLQ Refresh message, a server MUST send an
   acknowledgment of the Refresh. This acknowledgment is formatted like
   the Setup ACK described in 5.2.3, but with the following variations:

   The LLQ-OPCODE is set to LLQ-REFRESH.

   NO-SUCH-LLQ MUST be returned as an error code if the client attempts
   to refresh an expired or non-existent LLQ (as determined by the
   LLQ-ID in the request).

   The LLQ-ID in the acknowledgment is set to the LLQ-ID in the request.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-8" href="#section-8">8</a>. Security Considerations</span>

   Without care taken in the design of protocols such as this, servers
   may be susceptible to denial of service (DOS) attacks, and clients
   may be subjected to packet storms. Mechanisms have been added to the
   protocol to limit potential for these attacks.

   Note: This section contains no new protocol elements -- it serves
   only to explain the rationale behind protocol elements described
   above, as they relate to security.


<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-8.1" href="#section-8.1">8.1</a> Server DOS</span>

   LLQs require that servers be stateful, maintaining entries for each
   LLQ over a potentially long period of time. If unbounded in
   quantity, these entries may overload the server. By returning
   SERV-FULL in Request Acknowledgments, the sever may limit the maximum
   number of LLQs it maintains. Additionally, the server may return
   SERV-FULL to limit the number of LLQs requested for a single name and
   type, or by a single client. This throttling may be in the form of a
   hard limit, or, preferably, by token-bucket rate limiting. Such rate
   limiting should occur rarely in normal use and is intended to prevent
   DOS attacks -- thus it is not built into the protocol explicitly, but
   is instead implemented at the discretion of an administrator via the
   SERV-FULL error and the LEASE-LIFE field to indicate a retry time to
   the client.


<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-8.2" href="#section-8.2">8.2</a> Client Packet Storms</span>

   In addition to protecting the server from DOS attacks, the protocol
   limits the ability of a malicious host to cause the server to flood a
   client with packets. This is achieved via the four-way handshake
   upon setup, demonstrating reachability and willingness of the client
   to participate, and by requiring that gratuitous responses be ACK'd
   by the client.

   Additionally, rate-limiting by LLQ client address, as described in
   (8.1) serves to limit the number of packets that can be delivered to
   an unsuspecting client.


<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-8.3" href="#section-8.3">8.3</a> Spoofing</span>

   A large random ID greatly reduces the risk of spoofing either the
   client (by sending spoof events) or the server (by sending phony
   requests or refreshes).
