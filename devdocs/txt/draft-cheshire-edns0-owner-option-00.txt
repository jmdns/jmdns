   information: the identity of the sleeping server to which the records
   belong, and the Wake-on-LAN Magic Packet bit pattern which should be
   used to wake the sleeping server.  This document specifies the EDNS0
   option used to carry that additional information.


1.  Introduction

   The EDNS0 'Owner' Option is used by the DNS-SD Sleep Proxy Service.
   The DNS-SD Sleep Proxy Service [mDNS] [DNS-SD] uses a message format
   identical to that used by standard DNS Update [RFC2136] [RFC3007],
   with two additional pieces of information: the identity of the
   sleeping server to which the records belong, and the Wake-on-LAN
   Magic Packet [WoL] bit pattern which should be used to wake the
   sleeping server.  This document specifies the EDNS0 option [RFC2671]
   used to carry that additional information.

   The EDNS0 'Owner' Option is specified here with reference to the
   DNS-SD Sleep Proxy Service, but could also be used for other purposes
   not related to the Sleep Proxy Service.


2.  Conventions and Terminology Used in this Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in "Key words for use in
   RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [RFC2119].


3.  EDNS0 'Owner' Option

   When a server that supports the DNS-SD Sleep Proxy protocol goes to
   sleep, it communicates relevant DNS records, which describe its role
   on the network, to the Sleep Proxy, in one or more DNS Update
   messages [RFC2136] [RFC3007].  Typically these record registrations
   with the Sleep Proxy do not last forever; they have a finite
   lifetime, communicated using EDNS0 option 2 "DNS Update Lease"
   [DNS-UL].

   When the Sleep Proxy observes traffic on the network which warrants
   waking the sleeping server, it does so by sending a Wake-on-LAN
   "Magic Packet" [WoL].

   A Wake-on-LAN "Magic Packet" consists of the following bit-pattern:
   o  Sync sequence: 48 binary 1s (i.e. 6 bytes of 0xFF)

Internet-Draft             EDNS0 OWNER Option                  July 2009


   o  Sixteen repetitions of the 48-bit MAC address of the sleeping
      server's network interface
   o  Optional 32-bit or 48-bit 'password'

   When the Sleep Proxy determines that the sleeping server has awoken,
   it can cease proxying for that server.

   The Sleep Proxy needs to know the 48-bit MAC address (and possibly
   32-bit or 48-bit 'password') to use to wake the sleeping server.

   It also needs a way to determine when the sleeping server has awoken.
   Because, when a sleeping server wakes it may be attached to the
   network via a different interface (e.g. 802.11 wireless instead of
   Ethernet), merely observing the source MAC address in the packets it
   sends may not be sufficient to identify that this server on wireless
   is the same server that moments earlier went to sleep while attached
   via Ethernet.  Also, merely observing packets apparently originating
   from the sleeping server may not be sufficient to conclude reliably
   that it has woken -- since these could be old packets, from before it
   slept, that were delayed in transit.

   The necessary information is communicated in the EDNS0 'Owner'
   option:
   o  The 48-bit MAC address of the sleeping server's network interface
   o  Optional 32-bit or 48-bit 'password'
   o  A 48-bit value that uniquely identifies this machine regardless of
      which interface it is using.  Typically the MAC address of the
      machine's 'primary' interface is used for this purpose.
   o  A sleep/wake sequence number.  Each time the server wakes and
      begins a new period of wakefulness, this sequence number is
      incremented.  If the Sleep Proxy observes the server send a packet
      with the same sleep/wake sequence number as it saw in the proxy
      registration, this is an old packet delayed in the network and
      does not constitute evidence that the server has awoken.  If the
      Sleep Proxy observes the server send a packet with a different
      sleep/wake sequence number then the Sleep Proxy can conclude that
      the server has awoken and the proxy need not continue answering
      for it.

3.1.  EDNS0 'Owner' Option Format

   A full EDNS0 'Owner' option has the following format:

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |Opt|Len|V|S|Primary MAC|Wakeup MAC |Password   |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The two-byte EDNS0 Option code 'Opt' for the 'Owner' option is 4.



Cheshire, et al.         Expires January 7, 2010                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft             EDNS0 OWNER Option                  July 2009


   The two-byte length field 'Len' for this option is 24.

   The one-byte version field 'V' is currently zero.  In the current
   version of the protocol, senders MUST set this field to zero on
   transmission, and receivers receiving an EDNS0 option 4 where the
   version field is not zero MUST ignore the entire option.

   The one-byte sequence number field 'S' is set to zero the first time
   this option is used after boot, and then after that incremented each
   time the machine awakens from sleep.

   The six-byte Primary MAC field identifies the machine.  Typically,
   the MAC address of the machine's 'primary' interface is used for this
   purpose.

   The six-byte pattern to be repeated 16 times in the wakeup packet.
   This SHOULD be the MAC address of the interface through which the
   packet containing this 'Owner' option is being sent.

   The six-byte 'password' to be appended after the sixteen repetitions
   of the MAC address.

3.2.  Compact EDNS0 'Owner' Option Formats

   Where the 'password' is only four bytes, a shorter format is used,
   identified by the length field 'Len' having the value 22:

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |Opt|Len|V|S|Primary MAC|Wakeup MAC |Passwd |   (Len = 22)
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   When the 'password' is not required, it can be omitted entirely,
   identified by the length field 'Len' having the value 18:

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |Opt|Len|V|S|Primary MAC|Wakeup MAC |   (Len = 18)
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   In the common case where the 'password' is not required and the
   Primary MAC and Wakeup MAC are the same, both Wakeup MAC and password
   may be omitted, identified by the length field 'Len' having the value
   12:

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |Opt|Len|V|S|Primary MAC|   (Len = 12)
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

4.  Security Considerations

   When a Wake-on-LAN Magic Packet is sent to wake a machine up, it is
   sent in the clear, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping.


5.  IANA Considerations

   The EDNS0 OPTION CODE 4 has already been assigned for this DNS
   extension.  No additional IANA services are required by this
   document.
